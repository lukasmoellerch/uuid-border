tldr: The user wanted a full-screen web terminal using ghostty-web and an
  in-memory virtual PTY. The agent built a Next.js application, integrated the
  terminal, and iteratively refined the layout and resizing logic to ensure it
  filled the viewport correctly and handled window resizes without issues.
overview: The user's intent was to create a demonstration of , a
  WebAssembly-based terminal emulator, paired with an in-memory virtual PTY. The
  agent developed a Next.js application, setting up  as the
  frontend terminal and implementing a  class to simulate a basic
  Unix-like shell environment with a virtual filesystem and common commands. Key
  decisions involved dynamically importing  for client-side
  rendering and using a  to ensure the terminal dynamically
  adjusted its dimensions to fill the browser viewport. Challenges included
  debugging layout issues, preventing stretched text, and resolving a
  development-mode specific bug that caused the terminal to hang on loading. The
  outcome is a fully functional, full-screen web terminal that provides an
  interactive shell experience entirely within the browser.

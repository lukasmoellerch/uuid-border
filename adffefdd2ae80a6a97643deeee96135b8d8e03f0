tldr: The user wanted a full-screen web terminal demo using ghostty-web and an
  in-memory virtual PTY. The agent set up a Next.js project, integrated
  ghostty-web, and developed a VirtualPTY for a simulated shell, ensuring proper
  resizing and a clean, full-screen display.
overview: The user initiated a request to create a full-screen web terminal demo
  utilizing  and an in-memory virtual PTY. The agent began by
  setting up a Next.js project, integrating the  library, and
  developing a  class to simulate a basic Unix-like shell
  environment. The initial implementation included a comprehensive demo page,
  which was later streamlined to a minimalist full-screen terminal as per the
  user's preference. Key challenges involved achieving a truly full-screen
  layout without distorting text, implementing a  with
  debouncing for accurate terminal resizing, and resolving an issue where an
   guard interfered with hot reloading. The final solution
  provides a responsive, full-screen virtual terminal experience.
